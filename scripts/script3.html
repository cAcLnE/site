        <h3>Desert of Bones</h3>
        <p> Cracked lips.
<br> Thirst.
<br> The repetitive sound of dry sand scraping across dry eyes.  
<br> Scritch-Scratch.
<br> Scritch-Scratch.
<br> Your bones shift. 
<br> My bones shift. 
<br> What’s the difference now? You died two days ago. I’ve felt dead since then. 
<br> I remember sitting in that cave, you sitting against the wall opposite of me, our fire slowly going out because we couldn’t find any more scrub bush. 
<br> You crawled over to me and put your head in my lap. We began to sing. The song started in whispers that wriggled from the depths of our throats. Raspy wind, our mothers would have called it. It was a song for our mothers. An infantile cry for food from their breasts.  A cry for our mothers. The mothers that fed us. The mothers that raised us. The mothers that loved us. 
<br> Our dead mothers.
<br> Mothers.
<br> Bones now.
<br> Bones.
<br> Scritch-Scratch.
<br> Your bones shifted.
<br> My bones shifted.
<br> We never finished singing that song. You started coughing, a horrible sound that echoed around the cave. I pulled you up into my arms and we lay together for an eternity. My face in your hair. Your face in my neck. We lay together for not even a moment. 
<br> I woke up to my breathing. Not to yours. You had died in my arms. 
<br> I remember what you had told me before we left our mothers. If you had to die, you wanted to be in my arms when you did. You got your wish. I will never forgive you. 
<br> I remember what I told you before we left our mothers. If I had to die, I wanted it to be when we are old and living together in a place far away. Fate favored you more. 
<br> I will never forgive fate.
<br> Scritch-Scratch. 
<br> Bones against bones.
<br> Your bones settled.
<br> My bones shifted.
<br> I walked for a day, gathering scrub bushes and brittle leftovers of dead trees. When I returned I found your body had been picked apart by scavengers. Vultures or coyotes? I will never know. Nothing was there when I dropped to my knees and cried dry tears over your remains. 
<br> I burnt you on the pile of bushes and branches I had gathered. 
<br> The fire died.
<br> Died like you.
<br> Died like me.
<br> I took off my shirt and gathered your ashes and bones. My shirt, now acting as a sack for you, is tied around my neck.
<br> I walk with you on my back. 
<br> I will get you to where we were going.
<br> I won’t let my bones settle till we get there.
<br> Scritch-Scratch.
<br> The sound of my broken promise.
<br> We will get there. You will not die until we have lived our lives. 
<br> When you die, you will have tasted clean water. When you die, you will have eaten fresh bread. When you die, you will have heard the sound of birds. 
<br> When you die, you will have had my children. When you die, you will have had watched them grow. 
<br> When you die, you will be old and loved by more people than just me. 
<br> Scritch-Scratch.
<br> I lift my eyes. I see a desert we thought we could cross. I see the hopelessness of our dreams. 
<br> I see a man.
<br> A man that stands still at the top of the dunes I climb. He is naked and pale. His eyes picked from their sockets by the same thing that ate your remains.
<br> This man is the image of our mothers. 
<br> This man that can block out the sun.
<br> Your bones lie still.
<br> My bones settle.
<br> This man that couldn’t block out my last scream.
<br> “I am your skeleton, and I will carry you till I grind myself into the sand that I saved you from becoming!”
<br> This man is Death.
<br> And his domain is a desert of bones.
