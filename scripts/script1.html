        <h3>Blood of Oil</h3>
        <p>
         > Ever since a late night 20 years ago, Miriam and Niro Salvich have stressed over a horrifying prophecy <br>
  about their daughter, Vasilia, who, as the prophecy says, will be cursed with “blood of oil,” and a “monster deep inside.” <br>
  They have kept it a secret from everyone but themselves, and hope to keep it that way, <br>
  but keeping secrets could never halt fate’s course. They discover this when Jonas, a young mechanic following <br>
  the spread of industrialization and a new suitor to Vasilia, finds himself entwined deeper <br>
  in the family’s worries and misunderstandings than any of them could have predicted. <br> <br>
