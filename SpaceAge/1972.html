     <p><i>The moon landing did not take place on July 20th, 1969. <br>
      The first human to step on lunar soil was not Neil Armstrong. <br>
      The Apollo 11 mission never existed. <br> 
      It was all a hoax. <br> <br> 
      However, this does not mean that humanity never reached the moon. <br> 
      This milestone only took three more years to achieve. <br>
      The moon landing took place on August 1st, 1972. <br>
      The first human to step on lunar soil was <u>Erian Gradi</u>. <br>
      It went horribly wrong.  </i></p>
     <br> <br>
     <p>
        At some point in your life you will see the Space Man. <br> <br>
         Do not approach. <br>
         Do not run away. <br>
         Do not stare. <br>
         Do not interact with the Space Man in any way. <br> <br>
<b> Your existence on Earth depends on it.
