        <h3>Desert of Bones</h3>
        <p> Cracked lips.
<br> Thirst.
<br> The repetitive sound of dry sand scraping across dry eyes.  
<br> Scritch-Scratch.
<br> Scritch-Scratch.
<br> Your bones shift. 
<br> My bones shift. 
<br> What’s the difference now? 
<br> You died two days ago. 
<br> I’ve felt dead since then. 
<br> I remember sitting in that cave, you sitting against the wall opposite of me, our fire slowly going out because we couldn’t find any more scrub bush. 
<br> You crawled over to me and put your head in my lap. 
<br> We began to sing. 
<br> The song started in whispers that wriggled from the depths of our throats. 
<br> Raspy wind, our mothers would have called it. 
<br> It was a song for our mothers. 
<br> An infantile cry for food from their breasts. 
<br> A cry for our mothers. 
<br> The mothers that fed us. 
<br> The mothers that raised us. 
<br> The mothers that loved us. 
<br> Our dead mothers.
<br> Mothers.
<br> Bones now.
<br> Bones.
<br> Scritch-Scratch.
<br> Your bones shifted.
<br> My bones shifted.
<br> We never finished singing that song. 
<br> You started coughing, a horrible sound that echoed around the cave. 
<br> I pulled you up into my arms and we lay together for an eternity. 
<br> My face in your hair. 
<br> Your face in my neck. 
<br> We lay together for not even a moment. 
<br> I woke up to my breathing. 
<br> Not to yours. 
<br> You had died in my arms. 
<br> I remember what you had told me before we left our mothers. 
<br> If you had to die, you wanted to be in my arms when you did. 
<br> You got your wish. 
<br> I will never forgive you. 
<br> I remember what I told you before we left our mothers. 
<br> If I had to die, I wanted it to be when we are old and living together in a place far away. 
<br> Fate favored you more. 
<br> I will never forgive fate.
<br> Scritch-Scratch. 
<br> Bones against bones.
<br> Your bones settled.
<br> My bones shifted.
<br> I walked for a day, gathering scrub bushes and brittle leftovers of dead trees. 
<br> When I returned I found your body had been picked apart by scavengers. 
<br> Vultures or coyotes? 
<br> I will never know. 
<br> Nothing was there when I dropped to my knees and cried dry tears over your remains. 
<br> I burnt you on the pile of bushes and branches I had gathered. 
<br> The fire died.
<br> Died like you.
<br> Died like me.
<br> I took off my shirt and gathered your ashes and bones. 
<br> My shirt, now acting as a sack for you, is tied around my neck.
<br> I walk with you on my back. 
<br> I will get you to where we were going.
<br> I won’t let my bones settle till we get there.
<br> Scritch-Scratch.
<br> The sound of my broken promise.
<br> We will get there. 
<br> You will not die until we have lived our lives. 
<br> When you die, you will have tasted clean water. 
<br> When you die, you will have eaten fresh bread. 
<br> When you die, you will have heard the sound of birds. 
<br> When you die, you will have had my children. 
<br> When you die, you will have had watched them grow. 
<br> When you die, you will be old and loved by more people than just me. 
<br> Scritch-Scratch.
<br> I lift my eyes. 
<br> I see a desert we thought we could cross. 
<br> I see the hopelessness of our dreams. 
<br> I see a man.
<br> A man that stands still at the top of the dunes I climb. 
<br> He is naked and pale. 
<br> His eyes picked from their sockets by the same thing that ate your remains.
<br> This man is the image of our mothers. 
<br> This man that can block out the sun.
<br> Your bones lie still.
<br> My bones settle.
<br> This man that couldn’t block out my last scream.
<br> “I am your skeleton, and I will carry you till I grind myself into the sand that I saved you from becoming!”
<br> This man is Death.
<br> And his domain is a desert of bones.
